# STL

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of Swift classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc.

## Classes
### class Deque
Deque (usually pronounced like “deck”) is an irregular acronym of double-ended queue. Double-ended queues are sequence containers with dynamic sizes that can be expanded or contracted on both ends (either its front or its back).

### class ForwardList
ForwardLists are sequence containers that allow constant time insert and erase operations anywhere within the sequence.

### class List
Lists are sequence containers that allow constant time insert and erase operations anywhere within the sequence, and iteration in both directions.

### class OrderedMap
OrderedMaps are associative containers that store elements formed by a combination of a key value and a mapped value, following a specific order.

### class OrderedMultiMap
OrderedMultiMaps are associative containers that store elements formed by a combination of a key value and a mapped value, following a specific order, and where multiple elements can have equivalent keys.

### class OrderedSet
OrderedSets are containers that store unique elements following a specific order.

### class PriorityQueue
PriorityQueues are a type of container adaptors, specifically designed such that its first element is always the greatest of the elements it contains, according to some strict weak ordering criterion.

### class Queue
Queues are a type of container adaptor, specifically designed to operate in a FIFO context (first-in first-out), where elements are inserted into one end of the container and extracted from the other.

### class Stack
Stacks are a type of container adaptor, specifically designed to operate in a LIFO context (last-in first-out), where elements are inserted and extracted only from one end of the container.
